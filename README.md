# Small Talk Prompts

This project aims to improve your skills in thinking on your feet, e.g. in small
talk situations.

It does so by serving you a short question every day, that you can answer in a 1
to 2 minute speech to yourself, or with a study buddy.

The questions in `366-smalltalk-prompts.txt` were taken from
