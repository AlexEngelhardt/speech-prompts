# Speech Prompts

This project aims to improve your skills in thinking on your feet, e.g. in small
talk situations.

It does so by serving you a short question every day, that you can answer in a 1
to 2 minute speech to yourself, or with a study buddy. It's the same format as the Table Topics speeches in a Toastmasters meeting.

The English questions in `questions/questions-en.txt` were taken from [here](https://dist8tm.org/resources/#member), i.e.
